# ValorantAgentSelector
 Don't know who to play in VALORANT? With this Program you can either get a random Agent from a role you chose or a completely random Agent.

# How to add agents
 In order to add agents, either look for the "Agents.txt" file in the bin/debug folder. There you can add an Agent by writing his role and his name (I ordered them alphabetically, so you might wanna do that too), or you use the function in the program.
